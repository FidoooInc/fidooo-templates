# Fidooo Engineering Templates & Patterns

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to the patterns, structures, and key tools commonly used by Fidooo Engineering teams. It provides standardized approaches and best practices for various frameworks and technologies we work with.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- **Standardize** development practices across Fidooo Engineering teams
- **Document** proven patterns and structures for different frameworks
- **Share** knowledge about key tools and their optimal usage
- **Onboard** new team members with clear, consistent guidelines
- **Maintain** quality and consistency in our codebases

## Structure

Each framework or key tool has its own dedicated documentation file. For example:
- `next.md` - Next.js patterns, directory structure, and tools
- `react.md` - React component patterns and best practices
- `node.md` - Node.js backend patterns and tools
- `database.md` - Database design patterns and tools
- `deployment.md` - Deployment strategies and tools

## How to Use

1. **Browse** the relevant framework/tool documentation for your project
2. **Follow** the established patterns and directory structures
3. **Reference** the recommended tools and configurations
4. **Contribute** by updating patterns as we evolve our practices

## Contributing

When updating patterns or adding new framework documentation:
1. Ensure the pattern has been tested and proven effective
2. Include clear examples and explanations
3. Update this README if adding new framework documentation
4. Follow the existing documentation format

## Getting Started

Start by reading the documentation for the framework you're working with. Each file contains:
- Recommended directory structure
- Key tools and libraries
- Common patterns and conventions
- Best practices and guidelines
